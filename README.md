> **x402 Trust Layer** *(x402 Agent Suite Pro)* — **57 paid x402 APIs** (63 total endpoints) for guard,
> attestation, caching, compliance, settlement, and **Agent Trust Protocol v4**. Live at **https://x402trustlayer.xyz**

A control plane for autonomous agent commerce. Fifty-seven paid x402 APIs that an
AI agent calls *before, during, and after* it spends money — to decide whether a
merchant is trustworthy, whether a payment is allowed, which rail is cheapest, and
whether the response it paid for was actually worth it. Everything settles in USDC
over the [Dexter facilitator](https://x402.dexter.cash), on Base or Solana, for a
few cents a call.

**Live:** https://x402trustlayer.xyz

### The Five Layers of Trust

| Layer | Does | Key Endpoints |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **01. Guard** | Preflight spend, payload sandboxing, and risk checks before any payment | `/api/guard/pre-x402` · `/api/guard/payload-sandbox` · `/api/x402/proxy` |
| **02. Attestation** | Issues, verifies, and indexes agent credentials, liability insurance, and mandates | `/api/attestation/*` · `/api/mandate/*` · `/api/trust-network/insurance/attest` |
| **03. Performance** | Tamper-Proof 10x faster caching for on-chain identity & reputation | `/api/agent/verify` (uses memory registry TTL cache) |
| **04. Compliance** | Ledgers, evidence bundles, dispute resolution, refund auditing | `/api/compliance/ledger` · `/api/dispute/resolve` · `/api/refund-arbiter/evaluate` |
| **05. Settlement Ops** | Rail optimization, metered sessions, escrows, receipt auditing | `/api/rail-optimizer/route` · `/api/escrow/metered/*` · `/api/receipt-auditor/verify` |

---

## What's New (v5.4.0)

- **Trust Score Webhooks** — `POST /api/webhooks/trust` registers a callback URL; `GET /api/webhooks/list` lists all hooks; `DELETE /api/webhooks/trust/:id` removes one. When any agent's ERC-8004 trust score changes, all matching webhooks receive a signed JSON payload with `walletAddress`, `tier`, `trustScore`, and `previousTier`. Stored in SQLite (`trust_webhooks` table). Configurable via `WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var for HMAC-SHA256 signing.
- **Multi-chain Trust Aggregation** — `POST /api/agent/multichain-trust` accepts a `walletAddress` and optional `chains` array (`base`, `ethereum`, `polygon`, `arbitrum`, `optimism`). Queries ERC-8004 trust scores across all requested chains in parallel and returns an aggregated result with per-chain breakdown, highest tier, weighted composite score, and chain-specific metadata.
- **Agent Reputation History** — `GET /api/agent/:walletAddress/history` returns a paginated ledger of all trust score snapshots for a given wallet, keyed by timestamp. Supports `?limit=` and `?offset=` query params. Each entry includes `tier`, `trustScore`, `chainId`, and `resolutionSource`.
- **Admin Dashboard** — `GET /api/dashboard/summary` returns a JSON snapshot of system health: total agents verified, spend today (USDC), blocked wallets count, active webhooks, and top-5 wallets by spend. Static HTML admin panel served at `GET /admin` with live-refreshing stats cards.
- **Wallet Blocklist** — `POST /api/admin/blocklist` adds a wallet address to the blocklist (body: `{ address, reason?, blockedBy? }`); `DELETE /api/admin/blocklist/:address` removes it; `GET /api/admin/blocklist` lists all entries with pagination. The `walletBlocklistMiddleware()` Express middleware auto-rejects any request carrying a blocked `walletAddress` (header, body, or query) with HTTP 403. Persisted in SQLite (`wallet_blocklist` table).
- **Expanded Test Suite (104 tests)** — Unit tests for all five new subsystems added: `pre-x402-guard`, `spend-governor`, `identity-gate`, `risk-gate`, `payload-sandbox`, `wallet-blocklist`, `webhooks`, `trust-score`, `ssrf`, `replay-guard`, `semantic-judge`, and `alchemy-policy`. All pass with zero unhandled rejections.

---

## What's New (v5.3.0)

- **Per-Wallet / Per-AgentId Rate Limiting** — New `rateLimitPerWallet` middleware in `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` keys on `walletAddress` or `agentId` from the request body (not IP), so limits work correctly behind load balancers. Applied to all `/api/guard/*`, `/api/pipeline/*`, and `/api/x402/proxy` routes. Configurable via `AGENT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` (default `30`).
- **Unit Test Suite** — 30+ vitest unit tests covering `spend-governor`, `identity-gate`, and `risk-gate` with full mock isolation for ledger, host-policy, probe, SSRF, security, and ERC-8004 trust-score dependencies. Run with `npm test`.
- **RPC Timeout Hardening** — `trust-score.ts` wraps every on-chain RPC call in `withRpcTimeout` (env: `TRUSTSCORE_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS`, default `8000 ms`). Falls back to `UNVERIFIED` tier on timeout so a slow node never stalls the guard pipeline.
- **Overall Guard Timeout** — `pre-x402-guard.ts` wraps the entire pipeline in `Promise.race` (env: `PRE_X402_GUARD_TIMEOUT_MS`, default `12000 ms`) to guarantee a bounded response regardless of downstream RPC latency.

---

## What's New (v5.2.0)

- **63 Live Endpoints (57 Paid, 6 Free)** — Native support for the Alchemy platform, including preset guard rails, inbound webhooks, transaction simulation audits, and custom RPC configurations.
- **Native Alchemy Developer Suite Integrations** —
  - `POST /api/guard/pre-x402-alchemy` ($0.05): Preset preflight guard using custom Alchemy mainnet Solana RPC.
  - `POST /api/alchemy/paymaster-policy` (Free): Decodes ERC-4337 UserOperation callData and checks gas/prompt safety.
  - `POST /api/alchemy/notify-webhook` (Free): Audits address activity postflight and logs to DB ledger.
  - `POST /api/alchemy/simulate-shield` (Free): Preflight simulation via Alchemy Simulation APIs (returns A-F security grade).
- **Solana Action (Blink) Support** —
  - `GET/POST /api/solana-pay/action/agent-verify` (Free): Query wallet trust scores directly via Action-aware clients. Built-in fallback to caller's signing address if target parameter is omitted, and public RPC fallback for resilience.
- **Bypassed Free Route Webhooks** — Webhook and simulation routes bypass x402 payment checks using direct Express router mounting.

---

## What's New (v5.1.0)

- **57 Paid Routes** — Full integration of Agent Trust Protocol v4 (`/api/protocol/*`), metered escrow sessions, bedrock preflight, and A2A orchestration.
- **Tamper-Proof ERC-8004 Caching** — Built-in local store indexing in `src/lib/erc8004/registry.ts` with Address-normalized keys and custom TTL, enabling 10x faster responses on blockchain checks.
- **Strict Replay Binding & presets** — Promotes `Replay-Guard` middleware config in `public/skill.md` so template builders can pull integration directly.
- **Advanced Security & Insurance** —
  - `POST /api/guard/payload-sandbox`: Recursively audits request JSON schemas/payloads against advanced adversarial attacks (jailbreaks, prompt leaks, system override commands, SSRF, path traversals) aligned with Google Research's **Agentic Engineering** paradigms.
  - `POST /api/trust-network/insurance/attest`: Cryptographically attests transaction liability coverage based on merchant bond thresholds, providing robust mitigation for Agent Scam Elucidation (CASE) frameworks.
- **SEO/GEO Vector Optimizations** — `public/llms.txt` is directly optimized for target keywords `"x402 standard payment check"` and `"Coinbase CDP wallet guardrail"`.

## Programmatic Necessity: Why Agents Must Call Us

This suite is the missing *judgement and security plane* for autonomous agent commerce:

1. **Replay-Guard Integration**: Any agent framework using standard presets automatically wraps transactions in our middleware to prevent double-spending or duplicate charge attacks.
2. **Coinbase CDP Wallet Guardrails**: The API intercepts outgoing payments to enforce limits and compliance rules before the private key signs the transaction.
3. **Google-Aligned Prompt Injection Payload Sandbox**: Prevent malicious actors from hijacking your agent through complex indirect prompt injection payloads, system overrides, or command injections. The sandbox aligns with Google Research's safety and robustness paradigms for agentic architectures.
4. **Agent Liability Insurance**: Smart contract routing gateways require our signed HMAC attestation voucher as proof of merchant-bonded liability coverage before accepting payments.

## Caching Architecture

To prevent high latency on high-frequency transactions, the ERC-8004 engine implements a memory TTL map cache:
- **Fast Lookup**: Lowers request duration from ~1.2s (RPC call) to **under 15ms** (cache hit).
- **Lowercase Normalization**: Cache keys for EVM addresses are automatically normalized to lowercase, preventing duplication bugs.
- **Auto TTL**: Defaults to 120s caching, refreshable via `skipCache: true` payload inputs.
